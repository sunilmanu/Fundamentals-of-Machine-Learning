Machine Learning problems fall into below categories:



# Supervised learning 

In this the data comes with additional attributes that we want to predict.This problem can be either:

– classification: Samples belong to two or more classes and we want to learn from already labeled data how
to predict the class of unlabeled data. An example of a classification problem would be handwritten digit
recognition, in which the aim is to assign each input vector to one of a finite number of discrete categories.
Another way to think of classification is as a discrete form of supervised
learning where one has a limited number of categories and for each of the n samples provided, one is to
try to label them with the correct category or class.


1)Logistic Regression
2)

– regression: If the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called
regression. An example of a regression problem would be the prediction of the length of a salmon as a
function of its age and weight.



# Unsupervised learning

In this the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding
target values. The goal in such problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where
it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as density estimation,
or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of
visualization
